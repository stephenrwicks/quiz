A front-end only game where you can build a quiz. Then it saves your quiz in base64 to a url so you can share it. Once you take a quiz you can share your results with yet another base64 url. For fun I built it in plain TS with no css and just the bare minimum required html. All DOM manipulation and styling is done manually in the script. I also completely avoided using querySelector. ~June 2025
